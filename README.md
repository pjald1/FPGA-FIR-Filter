# FPGA-FIR-Filter

This project contains the files used to run an finite impulse response (FIR) filter on an Artix-7 FPGA board. The function of the FIR filter can be seen in 'src/my_FIR_filter.vhd', which contains the customised values for the impulse response as well as the DSP blocks and lookup tables (LUT) used for the internal signals.
